Murphy spins further yarns about where he has been and what he has seen in his travels; he produces a “picture postcard from his inside pocket” depicting “a group of savage women in striped loincloths” (16.472, 75-76) from his time in Bolivia.  Bloom subtly “turned over the card to peruse the partially obliterated address and postmark” to reveal that the card was actually sent to a Senor A Boudin in Chile (16.488-89), prompting Bloom to “nourish some suspicions of our friend’s _bona fides_” (16.498).

Richard Ellmann posits that Murphy demonstrates the difference between the artistic fiction that Joyce has created in _Ulysses_ and the misleading fiction of lies.  Yes, Joyce’s artistic masterpiece has sought to depict in great (but ultimately false) detail a real city filled with real people on a real day, but “with falsisimilitude Murphy would ambush the verisimilitude that is claimed in _Ulysses_, and turn Aristotle’s imitation of nature into mere fakery” (Ellmann 155).  More simply put, “In Eumaeus the sailor would change the impulse of art to create into the pseudo-artistic impulse to gull” (Ellmann 155).  In other words, _Ulysses_ uses fiction that resembles reality in order to tell truths, whereas Murphy uses fiction simply to deceive.
